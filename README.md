    A <b>Gradle plugin</b> that aids in compiling <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.6/">Solidity</a> sources with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, written in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>.

## üí° Introduction

This plugin was developed originally for [Exflo](https://github.com/41north/exflo). As current existing solutions are either old or relies on `groovy`, we thought it might be useful as this version is written using gradle's `kotlin-dsl`. 

## üôà Usage

To apply the plugin, use the gradle plugin syntax:

```groovy
plugins {
    id("dev.north.fortyone.solidity") version "0.1.0"
}
```

Once the plugin is applied, you can configure it with the following options (default values are displayed below):

```groovy
solidity {
    command.set("docker run --rm")
    solidityImage.set("ethereum/solc:stable")
    evmVersion.set(EVMVersion.ISTANBUL)
    outputComponents.set(listOf(OutputComponent.BIN, OutputComponent.ABI))
    overwrite.set(true)
    optimize.set(true)
    optimize.runs(0)
    prettyJson.set(false)
    ignoreMissing.set(false)
    allowPaths.set(emptyList())
}
```

A `solidity` source set will be available like a regular `java` or `kotlin`, so you can add your source code like usual.

## üóíÔ∏è Roadmap

* Add proper tests
* Handle properly allow paths
* Allow option to add extra arguments to solidity compiler
* ...
